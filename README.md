This is a plugin implemented in **Vimscript** language that can run in Vim.

This plugin enables one click annotation of **C++** code in normal mode, insertion mode, selection mode, and visual mode.

Reproduction is not allowed without permission.

At present, **only C++** is supported, and one click comments for languages such as Python, Pascal, Java, and Go will be updated in the future.

The current version number is 1.1.

If there is a problem, please contact me.

I dislike neovim,so this is a vim plugin.
